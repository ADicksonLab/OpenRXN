# OpenRXN
A free, open-source tool for modeling chemical reaction networks in Python.  Offers a single platform for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and reaction-diffusion equations. 

## Features
* definition of compartments, reactions and species as Python objects
* capable of stochastic (e.g. Gillespie) or deterministic modeling (e.g. ODEs)
* uses Pint for units throughout
* easy definition of 1D, 2D or 3D compartment arrays
* can visualize compartment connectivity as graphs (NetworkX)

## Dependencies
* NetworkX
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Pint
